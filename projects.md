## Stalled Works in Progress

### Pets and Fedoras
I'm currently working on [Pets and Fedoras](projects/pets-and-fedoras-slides).

You are fedora-wearing special agents of the NNSA (Never Named Spy Agency) with cover identities as ordinary house pets belonging to a pair of genius children, Linneaus and Fern. Your mission, as always, is to find out what your evil scientist nemesis, Dr. Goofenheim, is up to and put a stop to it!

This work is a dice-less, GM-less, story-game directly inspired by the cartoon Phineas and Ferb.

### A Heartbreaker
I've been working on and off on a [heartbreaker](projects/heartbreaker), which is essentially a riff on `the world's most popular role-playing game'. I've never been completely satisfied with it, but I'm going to put it out there on the internet anyway. Maybe this will be the push for me to complete it.

## Completed Works

### [Hot Mutant Vigilantes]((/projects/hot-mutant-vigilantes))

You are a HOT MUTANT VIGILANTE. More specifically, you are a student at a school for gifted youngsters where the extra-curricular activities involve dressing up in spandex and defending the world. The school has zero legal authority to do this, hence the label ‘vigilante’. The government and the humans hate you. This work is a hack of [Grant Howitt’s Sexy Battle Wizards](https://gshowitt.itch.io/sexy-battle-wizards) and is directly inspired by the X-men.


### I Love You But We Must Fight

I Love You But We Must Fight is a solo journaling game where you play a single Hero tasked with defeating the Great Villain threatening the world. You’ve fought hard, sacrificed much, and now you are preparing for the final showdown. There’s only one hiccup: you love the Villain, and you wish to defeat them without destroying them. This game aims to tell stories like Star Wars and Naruto. To play, you need a copy of this game's rules, a deck of cards, a six-sided die. 

### Hot Dog Borg

Hot Dog Borg is a silly hack of Mork Borg, in which you play as a Hot Dog Karate-ka, and my submission for the Noun Borg Get Rich Quick Jam.
