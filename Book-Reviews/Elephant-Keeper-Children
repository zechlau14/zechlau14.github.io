Title: The Elephant Keeper's Children -- Review
---

## What the Book is about
The Elephant Keeper's Children, written by Peter Hoeg, follows the adventures of two teenagers as they investigate the disappearance of their parents.

## My Review

### My Rating: 4.5 / 5

### What I liked:
The Elephant Keeper's Children reads like part fairty tale, part philosophical discussion about the meaning of life, and part comedy with recurring jokes. 
These parts are all held together by its 14-year-old protagonist's precarious narration.

### Who would like reading this?
Fans of scandinavian literature, fiction with philosophical themes and comedic writing.
