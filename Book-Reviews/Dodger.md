Title: Dodger Review

## What the Book is about
Dodger, written by Terry Prachet, is a reimagining of the story of the Artful Dodger character from Charles Dickens' *Oliver Twist*. The book begins with the street urchin Dodger rescuing a young woman who is being kidnapped. We then follow our protagonist as he investigates the identity of the kidnappers to put an end to the threat once and for all.

## My Review
### What I liked:
The book is written in Dodger's point of view, giving us a street urchin's guided exploration of Victorian London's less glamorous side and the characters doing their best to survive.

### My Rating: 3.5 / 5
Overall, I found the book an enjoyable read. However, I felt the plot lacked a little tension to be considered one of Prachet's better works.

### Who would like reading this?
Fans of Terry Prachett, the Victorian era, and rascally protagonists.
