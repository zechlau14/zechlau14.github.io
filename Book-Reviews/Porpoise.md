Title: The Porpoise -- Review
---

## What the Book is about
The Porpoise, written by Mark Haddon, is a story about an abused girl and the Ancient Greek-inspired fantasy that she dreams up to escape the pain of her reality.

## My Review

### My Rating: 3.5 / 5

### What I liked:
The Porpoise is literally escapist fiction.
The language is descriptive, transporting you in a blur between the modern horror and the ancient greek fantasy.

### Who would like reading this?
Lovers of Tragedy and Greek myths; and people who have the time to follow a twisting narrative.
