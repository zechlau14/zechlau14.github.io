Welp! That blogging and game writing streak didn't last.

I really didn't expect that I had been away from it for over 14 months.

It's been a long time since I played a game. I really miss it but life has been forcing its way in and I haven't been pushing back hard enough to get a game going.
And I don't know if I will be able to anytime soon.

What does that mean for this blog? For now, I'm planning to just update the recipe section because no matter how busy I get, I still have to eat. After that, who knows?

I don't think I really cultivated much of an audience, but if I did and you are disappointed, I'm sorry.


Peace, Mr. Zech.
