Last year, I became a member of my local library. It has been a really good deal. 
For a yearly membership fee that is equivalent to the price of a large latte, I can borrow 10 books at a time for up to 1-2 months.

My wife has been encouraging me to write reviews for the books I've read, so I'm seriously considering adding a new section to this website.
If I do go ahead with it, here are the books that I've read so far in 2025 that will be in it:
*  Dodger / Terry Pratchett
*  VOX MACHINA KITH & KIN / MARIEKE NIJKAMP
*  The Elephant Keepers' Children / Peter Hoeg
*  The Mysterious Case of the ALPERTOn AnGELS / Janice Hallett
*  The strange library / Haruki Murukami ; translated by Ted Goossen
*  The Swiss Family Robinson / TRANSLATION FROM THE ORIGINAL GERMAN BY WILLIAM H.G. KINGSTON ; EDITED BY JOHANN RUDOLS WYSS
*  The trials of Solomon Parker / Eric Scott Fischl
*  The binding / Bridget Collins
*  The hazel wood / Melissa Albert
*  The MUSEUM of ORDINARY PEOPLE / MIKE GAYLE

Peace, Mr Zech.
