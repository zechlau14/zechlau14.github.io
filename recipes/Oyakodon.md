## Ingredients
* 1/2 Onion
* 2 chicken thighs
* 1 Tbsp Sake
* 3-4 Large Eggs
* Green Onions

Seasonings:
* 1/2 cup dashi
* 2 Tbsp soy sauce
* 2 Tbsp mirin
* 2 tsp sugar

## Instructions
1. Cut chicken into bite-size. Sprinkle with sake and set aside for 5 minutes.
2. Prepare pour-ins: Combine dashi, soy sauce, mirin and sugar to form sauce. In a separate bowl, gently mix eggs (do not completely whisk).
3. Without heat, place onions and sauce in frying pan.
4. Turn heat onto medium and bring to simmer.
5. Once simmering, add chicken on top of onions.
6. Once simmering again, lower heat to medium low. Cook uncovered until the chicken is no longer pink and onions are tender, about 5 minutes. Halfway through, flip chicken.
7. While simmering, drizzle over two-thirds of eggs, avoiding the edges of the pan.
8. When the eggs are still runny but just set, add the remaining third of eggs. Add the green onions on top and cook until egg is done.
