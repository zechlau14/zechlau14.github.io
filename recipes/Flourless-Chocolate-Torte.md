title: Flourless Chocolate Torte

---

## Ingredients

* 9 oz chocolate

* 3/4 cup unsalted butter

* 1/4 tsp salt

* 6 large eggs

* 3/4 cup sugar

* 2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 160 C

2. Melt butter over low heat. When almost melted, add chocolate, stirring until almost all melted. Remove from heat, and stir until chocolate is completely melted. Set aside to cool.

3. In a medium bowl, beat egg whites until soft peaks form. Then add 1/3 of sugar, beating until stiff peaks form.

4. In a large bowl, beat egg yolks and remaining sugar until very thick and pale yellow.

5. Add the melted butter and chocolate mixture to the egg yolk mixture. Beat on low speed until evenly combined.

6. Add cocoa powder, and continue beating on low speed.

7. Gently fold egg whites into the mixture, about one third at a time, until evenly mixed. If there is a little unmixed egg white, it's okay.

8. Gently spoon mixture into prepared pan, and spread evenly. 

9. Bake for approximately 35-40 min. Then let cool completely in the pan.
