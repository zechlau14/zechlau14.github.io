---

## Ingredients
* 10 dried shiitake mushrooms, about 35g
* 400g chicken
* 2 green onions
* 2 inch ginger
* 1 whole star anise
* 1 tbsp Shaoxing wine
* 1 tbsp light soy sauce
* 1/2 tbsp dark soy sauce
* 1/2 tsp sugar
* 1/4 tsp salt

## Instructions
1. Rehydrate dried mushrooms with warm water, about 20 minutes. Reserve soaking water.
2. Brown chicken and set aside.
3. Bloom star anise, green onion stalks and ginger.
4. Add chicken and 1 cup of mushroom water. Then cover chicken with regular water. Add Shaoxing wine, light and dark soy sauce, sugar and salt. Cook over medium-high heat until brought to a boil. Skim and discard any brown foam.
5. Add mushrooms, then cover the pan. Keep at a low boil until the chicken turns tender, about 30 minutes. Stir after 15 minutes to prevent sticking.
6. Turn heat to high and boil uncover to reduce the sauce, about 5-10 minutes. Pay attention to prevent burning bottom.
